# Hello World!
## Description
This is my first attempt at working with Markdown. I tend to make tests things like:
- An unordered list
- multiple bullet points

### And Even Another Header Type! 

I know, it looks clunky right now, but remember, this is a sandbox area for my learning. Later on, I will have a much cleaner document beatifued and ready ~~to be ooed and awed!~~ *Okay, that might be a bit much, but we can hope.* In any case, I hope you've enjoyed reading and viewing my first attempt at Markdown, and I hope to see you stick around **for awhile**. In the meantime, feel free to view the ***rest of the content*** available on my site. I hope you feel right at home!
